#####`Demonstrative` pipe example
![[pipeline_example.png]]
$$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi} $$
Inline image ![[pipeline_example.png]] Above is the partial output of the command `$ ls /bin /usr/bin`. These are the binary executables in the file system.
Say, we wanted to remove the white text. 
`$ ls /bin /usr/bin |grep -v '/bin:$'` 
**Aside**, `:` (colon) is a literal colon and is not a meta-character.
The `-v` or `--invert-match` means, everything that does not match the grep string will be printed to standard out. 
```shell
Â $ ls /bin /usr/bin |grep -v '/bin:$'
```
